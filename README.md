# Inception V4 Using PyTorch Image Models (TIMM)

This program is an image classification model to recognize which image is which.

## Usage
To use this program, set the desired classes at finetune.py and rewrite the list (object names must be available from raw.txt) run the finetune.py then go to inception.ipynb and set the image link at cell 4 variable url to recognize the image. Then run all cells it will print the result on the last cell.

#### THIS IS CURRENTLY NOT FINE TUNE, JUST FILTERING SEVERAL ITEMS INSTEAD OF DELETING THE UNUSED DATASETS

## This is the second intern test module for PT. Kazee Digital Indonesia, for private company usage.
